description: Shani consulted with a top B2B sales manager to uncover the mental model of his clients - salesmen themselves - and their clients, people who purchase countertops. They collected data by interviewing existing customers, uncovering their values and key assumptions. Shani then helped the sales manager create a pitch that is 65% more effective than his former sales presentation.
