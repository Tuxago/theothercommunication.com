  I would especially like to highlight the great degree to which Shani customized the agenda of the training fully adapting it to our needs. It would not be an exaggeration to say that she even picked up on things we could not really voice ourselves and offered practical solutions and guidance. Also, the materials she prepared were totally “spot on”. Finally, another very positive aspect was the choice of partner co-instructors. They were both highly knowledgeable and good at connecting with us.
